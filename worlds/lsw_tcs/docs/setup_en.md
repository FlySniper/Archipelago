## Connecting to the Archipelago server
When connecting to a multiworld for the first time, a new game should be started.

To connect to the multiworld server, run the **Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga Client** from the Archipelago Launcher
and connect it to the Archipelago server. Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga must be running before a connection can be
made.

The first time a save file connects to an Archipelago server, the slot name needs to be entered. After that, the slot
name will be set into the save data and read automatically from the save file by the client when connecting.
