# Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga

Work-in-progress.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Story Mode is skipped, all levels are played in Free Play.

To unlock a level, all Story Mode characters for that level must be acquired and the corresponding Episode Unlock item
must be received.

The player always start with Episode 1 unlocked, as well as Qui-gon Jinn, Obi-wan Kenobi and TC-14 unlocked.

## What items and locations get randomized?

Characters, Extras and Minikits are in the item pool.

Making purchases from the Characters or Extras shop are locations to check.

Completing a level in Free Play is a location to check.

Completing the True Jedi for a level is a location to check.

Every 1-10 number of Minikits collected in a level is a check.

## What other changes are made to the game?

Purchases in the Characters shop and Extras shop will not award their vanilla Characters/Extras.

Slots in the Characters shop that would normally unlock upon completing Story mode in every level now unlock once all
Episode have been unlocked.

## What does another world's item look like in Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga?

All items display as they would in vanilla.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

The item is immediately added to your unlocked Extras/Characters/Stud count. A text display in-game may show what the
received item was.

Studs are added to your total accumulated Studs rather than your in-level Studs, so the effect of receiving Studs is
not noticeable without returning to the Cantina.

## Can I play offline?

No, a connection to the Archipelago server is required to receive items, even in a single-player multiworld.

If the connection to the Archipelago server is lost, it is possible to continue playing. Any checked locations while
disconnected will be sent once the connection is reestablished.
